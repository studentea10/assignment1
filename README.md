# MultiU Authentication Processor App
# Overview
The MultiU Authentication Processor App is designed to enhance digital security for cryptocurrency users by improving two-factor authentication (2FA) methods. This project focuses on using API keys and requiring proof of identity to provide a more secure alternative to current 2FA methods, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing the overall security of cryptocurrency transactions.

# Features
Secure API Key Management: Generates and manages API keys using personal codes for enhanced security.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Utilizes Flutter for front-end development to ensure a consistent user experience across mobile and web platforms.
Real-Time Data Synchronization: Leverages Firebase for efficient and secure data management.
Robust Server-Side Operations: Flask is used to handle authentication and API key management securely.
Technologies Used
Flutter: For front-end development, providing a native-like user experience across platforms.
Firebase: Used for database management and real-time data synchronization.
Flask: Manages server-side logic, including API key generation and user authentication.
